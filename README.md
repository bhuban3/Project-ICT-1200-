Online Shopping Cart System
Online shopping cart system is a simple, console-based shopping cart application written in C. This program allows users to load products from a file, add or remove items from a cart, view the current cart contents, and save the cart for future sessions. It also personalizes the experience by greeting the user by name in the cart summary.
Features
•	Load Products from File: Loads a list of available products from products.txt.
•	Add to Cart: Allows users to select products by ID and specify a quantity to add them to the cart.
•	Remove from Cart: Enables users to remove products from the cart by ID.
•	Show Cart: Displays the items in the cart along with the total price and a personalized greeting.
•	Save and Load Cart: Saves the cart contents to cart.txt when exiting and loads it on the next program launch.

•	1. Show Products: Displays all available products with their prices.
